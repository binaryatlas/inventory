# inventory
This is  aproject i started and got to the debuging stage and it was canceled. I didnt want this to just die.
So I am going to make some cahnges. I want to make this more generalized so people can clone it and use it in their environments.
Also i was forced to use mssql instead of mysql which i think is a much better database in my opinion.
It is also tied to an active directory and that needs to be moved to a local database.

There are no implied warranties with this. You fork it you work on it it kills something its on you. This is my first git project so I am new. If you see anything wrong please let me know.
